        <h2 class="secheadw">About the Course</h2>
        <h3 class="sylhead">Course Description</h2>
        <p class="sylbody">The conditions of effective thinking and clear communication. Examination of the basic principles of deductive reasoning.</p>
        <h3 class="sylhead">Required Text</h2>
        <p class="sylbody"><i>A Modern Formal Logic Primer</i> by <a href="http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/fzteller">Paul Teller.</a> </br><a href="http://tellerprimer.ucdavis.edu/pdf/">Available for free here.</a></p>
        <h3 class="sylhead">Informal Description</h2>
        <p class="sylbody">In this course you will learn what it really means to prove something.  A real proof is a thing of beauty, but it takes quite a bit of work to appreciate this.  If this course is successful, then at least once before the  end of the semester, the        beauty of a deductive proof will smack you hard right between the eyes.  You will shed tears of joy, and you will be forever changed. (Unfortunately, this form of success is difficult to test, and does not guarantee  a passing grade.)</p>
        <p class="sylbody">There is actually quite a bit more to logic than proof, however.  Symbolic logic is the most precise form of notation ever developed, and has been absolutely        fundamental to contemporary developments in in mathematics, linguistics, computer science and, yes, philosophy.  Simply becoming comfortable with logical notation is an enormous benefit to anyone who would like to do advanced work     in these fields.  More generally, the course will also develop your ability to think carefully and precisely in an abstract way, which will be useful to you in all future studies.</p>

        <div class="col1"> <h3>Attendance and Classroom Etiquettes</h3><p>I do not take attendance in this course.  Missing class frequently is, however, in general a very bad idea. Students are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for absence. It is also the absentee's responsibility to get all missing notes or materials. You are free to use the computer, so long as it is used in a conscientious manner, but frankly logic is a pen-and-paper subject and from experience students who take notes on papers tend to do better in my course. If you do use computer, however, please refrain from having too much fun.</p> </div>
        <div class="col1"> <h3>Classwork</h3><p>20% of the class grade will consist of assignments done in class. In general, I will go over these classwork in class; moreover, classwork that are handed in at the designated time (usually by the end of the class session) will automatically receive a full score. It is possible to make up classwork if you miss class, but it will be graded like a homework. Sometimes classwork will occur in the form of a small quiz. In that case, it will be graded accordingly.</p> </div>
       <div class="col1"> <h3>Office Hours</h3><p>Office hours will be by appointments only, but I will make myself readily available. Office hours seem to me a relic of the past, when professors were not easily contacted, but now we have emails. So, if you would like to meet with me, just talk to be after class or email. Depending on my schedule, I might ask you to either meet me in my office on East or somewhere on West, such as the Perk. </p> </div>
       <div class="col2"> <h3>Getting in touch</h3><p>By far the most effective means of communicating with me is by e-mail.  Unless you send an email late at night, you will normally receive an answer within a few hours. Re-send your e-mail if you do not. I will try to answer your questions in emails, but if the problem gets too involved I might suggest setting up a meeting instead.</p> </div>
        <div class="col2"> <h3>Accommodations</h3><p>Students requiring special accommodations should contact the Duke University Student Disability Access Office at (919) 668-1267 to explore possible coverage. For academic assistance available to all Duke undergraduate students, as well as additional services for students with learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder, please inquire with the Academic Resource Center at (919) 684-5917.</p> </div>
         <div class="col2"> <h3>Honor Code</h3><p>The Duke University Community Standard is in effect in this class, as it is in all classes at the university. Academic and personal integrity are serious matters, and will be treated as such in this course. Instructors and students alike are responsible for upholding both the spirit and the letter of the Standard. Students must understand its content and should clarify any questions they might have.</p> </div>
