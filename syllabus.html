						<button class="control">In this course you will learn what it really means to <i>prove something.</i></button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p>  A real proof is a thing of beauty, but it takes quite a bit of work to appreciate this. If this course is successful, then at least once before the end of the semester, the beauty of a deductive proof will smack you hard right between the eyes. You will shed tears of joy, and you will be forever changed. (Unfortunately, this form of success is difficult to test, and does not guarantee a passing grade.)</p>
							<p>There is actually quite a bit more to logic than proof, however. Symbolic logic is the most precise form of notation ever developed, and has been absolutely fundamental to contemporary developments in in mathematics, linguistics, computer science and, yes, philosophy. Simply becoming comfortable with logical notation is an enormous benefit to anyone who would like to do advanced work in these fields. More generally, the course will also develop your ability to think carefully and precisely in an abstract way, which will be useful to you in all future studies. </p>
							<p>At the completion of this course, you will be able to explain key concepts such as consistency, contradiction, identity, tautology, and validity, use techniques such as truth tables and natural deduction to evaluate these concepts, formalize statements in natural language, and express and understand propositions in the languages of sentence and predicate logic. </p>
						</div>
						</li>
						<li>
						<button class="control">This is a self-paced course.</button>
						<div class="panel">

							<p> What this means is that you will study at your own pace and you will decide when to take a particular test. After the first week of the semester it will become possible to take tests during any class meeting.</p>
							<p> Nevertheless, the class has a structured progression, so perhaps it's best describe it as semi-self-paced, for it will never be possible to take more than one test per class meeting. As a result, there will become a point where it is logically impossible to take enough tests to pass the class. Hence, it is extremely important for you to keep yourself on a strict test taking schedule.  Moreover, you will not be permitted to take a test until you have  passed the previous one at a designated level. This level will be high, corresponding to a strong B or better in almost all cases. The reason for this is that the material is progressive. If you do not master the material at a certain level, you will find the subsequent level impossible to understand.</p>

						<button class="control">The structure of this class aims to accommodate the diverse backgrounds and learning styles of students, and provide the individual attention in accordance to the need of each student.</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p> If you are a self-motivated student who can do steady consistent work, you should succeed in this class without much issues. On the other hand, if you thrive under guidance, I will provide individual attention based on your style and needs. This course is not designed to have you do everything on your own, but to give the help and structure that suit each student's individual needs. </p>
							<p>At any time, feel free to speak to me about ways in which your learning could be better facilitated. The openness and freedom offered by the structure of this course allows the course to adapt to your learning style, and not the other way around.</p>

						<button class="control">Each class is divided into a brief lecture period, a study period, and a test taking period.</button>
						<div class="panel">
							<p> In general, a class meeting will begin with attendance taking and usually but not always a brief lecture. You are encouraged to engage the assigned reading for each modules and to read my notes before coming to class, since class time is intended to providing individual and small-group tutoring as well as to quizzing at the beginning and testing during the final half hour or so of each class. You are free to bring laptops, tablets, etc. While taking tests and quizzes, you may use none of these.  During the test taking period for each class, quiet will be required. </p>

						<p> Attendance policy is strictly enforced. You will need to arrange in advance with me, and provide a sufficient justification for the need for more than three absences. Use these absences wisely. They are for academic, personal, and professional events that are beyond your control. </p>

					<button class="control">Three tardies amount to one absence.</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p> It is very important to arrive to class on time. Arriving late to class counts as one third of an absence (therefore 3 tardies = 1 absence); if you arrive more than 15 minutes late to class, you will be counted as absent.</p>

					<button class="control">If you are sick, be sure to let me know.</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>Missing classes because of sickness will be counted as one of the three no-question-asked absences. In fact, it would be a perfect instance of the intended use of the allowed absences. However, if you keep me in the loop, you are much more likely to have your extra absence excused should you need it later on.</p>.

In order to receive a B or above in this class you must additionally complete the number of participatory assignments required for each grade. See specific requirements for assignments below.  </p>
									<p> There is no penalty for failing a test - your grade will not be affected and you are allowed to retake the test as many times as you like, assuming we have the class time for it. However, keep in mind that you are allowed to take one test per class period.

You may not take any test prior to passing the corresponding quiz. You can request to take a quiz at the beginning of each class session.  Your grades on quizzes do not figure into your overall course grade.</p>
									<p>  	If you pass the quiz, you will be permitted to take the test in the same session, or any class afterward. If you fail the quiz, the quiz will be returned to you with the number of incorrect answers on it; however, it will not specify which of the answer(s) were incorrect. Nevertheless, you are free to consult your notes and/or collaborate with your classmates. I will also answer any question you may have, though I will not directly give you the answers.</p>
									<p> Normally, I would not permit the failed quiz to be retaken on the same day, for your time would be better spent on carefully studying the materials and working homework problems, instead of simply guessing over and over again until you stumble on the right answer. However, I may make an exception if I feel that you are sufficiently close to passing.</p>

For each grade from B+ or above, there is a corresponding number of projects required, as specified in the table above. For your PA to qualify for credit, it must be approved by me beforehand.</p>
									<p>  	For example, to get a B+ in this class, you need to pass 10 tests and complete one PA. To get an A you need to past all 12 tests, and complete three PAs, but you are free to take on a PA at any time, so long as it is approved by me.</p>
									<p>You are encouraged to work on these assignments in class, and ask me for clarification and/or guidance. </p>

								<button class="control">P.A. option #1: Tutoring:</button>
								<div class="panel">
									<p> One way to receive a B+ or above in this class is to help other students learn by spending time in class tutoring. These opportunities will be arise when the need arises, and I will offer inform the students who have reached the appropriate level the opportunity. These tutoring sessions will occur during class time, but not during the test period (last 30 minutes of the class).</p>
								</div>
								</li>
								<button class="control">P.A. option #2: Presentations:</button>
								<div class="panel">
									<p> One option to fulfill your PA requirement is to give fifteen minutes presentation on a narrowly and strictly defined topic, approved by me. The easier topic would be to discuss an idea covered in the text, and a detailed walk-through of a problem that illustrates the concepts you intended to cover. </p>

									<p>It is possible to present on novel subjects, given my approval. For instance, you might give a presentation on how you used logic in your work for other courses, or you could present on the history of the development in logic. There is also a plethora of philosophical topics you could present.</p>

								</div>
								</li>
								<button class="control">P.A. option #3: Logic Problem Creation</button>
								<div class="panel">
									<p> Another option is to submit your own logic problems, modeled after the ones in assignments, tests, and exams. You must provide solutions to these problems. Your work must be reasonably substantial - it should amount to roughly a page and a half of work. </p>
